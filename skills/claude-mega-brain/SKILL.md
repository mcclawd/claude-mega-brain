# claude-mega-brain — OKF Knowledge Navigator

When `<mega-brain>` context is present, an OKF (Open Knowledge Format) knowledge base lives in this project. It is the authoritative source for domain knowledge: schemas, metrics, APIs, runbooks, business definitions.

## What OKF files look like

```yaml
---
type: BigQuery Table        # required — concept type
title: Orders
description: One row per completed customer order.
resource: https://...       # link to the actual resource
tags: [sales, revenue]
timestamp: 2026-05-28T14:30:00Z
---

# Schema
| Column | Type | Description |
...

# Joins
Joined with [customers](../tables/customers.md) on `customer_id`.
```

## Navigation

1. **index.md first** — maps all concepts with summaries and links
2. **Follow links** — `[text](rel-path.md)` links resolve inside the OKF dir; use the Read tool
3. **log.md** — chronological changelog; check when staleness matters
4. **Linked concepts are auto-injected** — when you read an OKF file, linked concept summaries appear automatically in context (PostToolUse hook)

## Path resolution

Paths in `<mega-brain>` are relative to the OKF dir. Resolve as:
`Read(<project_root>/<okf_dir>/<path>)`

Project root = `$PWD` (where Claude Code is running).

## When to proactively read OKF files

- User asks about a data source, metric, or system matching a concept in the index
- Before writing SQL, queries, or code that depends on schema details
- When a business term is ambiguous — OKF has canonical definitions
- User says "check the knowledge base" or "what do we know about X"

## Project config (.mega-brain.json)

Optional per-project overrides:

```json
{
  "dir": "knowledge",
  "maxConcepts": 100,
  "priorityTypes": ["Metric", "BigQuery Table"]
}
```
